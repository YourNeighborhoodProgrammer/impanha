				Have you ever wondered how to make your website look good without
				writing a lot of custom CSS? If you have, you might want to check out
				Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework that lets you style your
				elements with pre-built classes. Unlike regular CSS, which requires you
				to write selectors, properties, and values, Tailwind CSS allows you to
				apply styles directly in your HTML markup.
			</p>

			<p class="text-gray-600">
				In this article, I will explain why Tailwind CSS is easier than regular
				CSS, and how it can help you create beautiful and responsive websites
				faster. I believe that Tailwind CSS is easier than regular CSS for two
				reasons: it saves you time and its efficent.

			<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">It Saves You Time</h2>

			<p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
				One reason why Tailwind CSS is easier than regular CSS is that it saves
				you time. Writing regular CSS can be time-consuming, especially for
				complex layouts. You have to write selectors, properties, and values,
				and sometimes use media queries, flexbox, or grid system to make your
				website responsive. Tailwind CSS, on the other hand, provides a number
				of pre-built utility classes that you can use to style your elements
				quickly and easily.
			</p>

			<p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
				For example, to create a flex container with centered items and red
				text, you can simply write:
			</p>

			<pre class="bg-gray-900 text-white p-4 mb-4">
&lt;div class="flex justify-center items-center text-red"&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;Container 1&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;Container 2&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;Container 3&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
			</pre
			>

			<p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
				This is much shorter and simpler than writing regular CSS, which would
				look something like this:
			</p>

			<pre class="bg-gray-900 text-white p-4 mb-4">
.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  color: red;
}
			</pre
			>

			<pre class="bg-gray-900 text-white p-4 mb-4">
&lt;div class="flex-container"&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;Container 1&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;Container 2&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;Container 3&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
			</pre
			>

			<p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
				According to a blog post by Material Tailwind, Tailwind CSS can help you
				write CSS faster, especially for complex layouts. The author claims that
				Tailwind CSS reduces the amount of code you have to write, and
				eliminates the need for naming CSS classes, which can be a hassle in
				larger projects.
			</p>

			<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">It Promotes Consistency</h2>

			<p class="text-gray-600">
				In conclusion, Tailwind CSS is easier than regular CSS as it saves time
				for developers trying to name their CSS classes, prevents unused CSS
				being shipped with the website.</p
